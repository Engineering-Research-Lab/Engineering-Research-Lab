- The software is able to learn, interact, and deepen its understanding through communication with its user/interlocutor.
- It can operate as a topic teacher, such as in the field of astronomy, and answer questions based on its stored memory.
- The software supports conversation in text-to-text, text-to-voice, and speech-to-voice modes and can recognize voice input.
- The robot control mechanism includes eye and head tracking, allowing for eye contact with the user, and lip synchronization with speech.

### Research on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics 

The project began in 2016 with a focus on multidisciplinary engineering, utilizing techniques in computational linguistics, natural language processing, machine and robot learning, computer vision, and mechatronics. The goal of the research is to design and investigate synthetic entity architecture, information processing algorithms, and control methods to create building blocks for a learning and dialogue system, integrated with humanoid and bio-inspired robotics. The aim is to invent a prototype design with a focus on assistive, educational, and therapeutic applications through a human-machine interface.
