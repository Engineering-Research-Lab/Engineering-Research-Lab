# Exploring the Capabilities of a Humanoid Robot with a Natural Language Processing Interface: An Overview of the Terbinari Operating Program

# Introduction

The Terbinari software and device is an artificial conversational entity that performs natural language processing, understanding, and generation. It is composed of a chat-bot interface and a humanoid robot control mechanism, which includes a cervical motility device for speech motion and facial detection/recognition.

# Functionality

- The software is able to learn, interact, and deepen its understanding through communication with its user/interlocutor.
- It can operate as a topic teacher, such as in the field of astronomy, and answer questions based on its stored memory.
- The software supports conversation in text-to-text, text-to-voice, and speech-to-voice modes and can recognize voice input.
- The robot control mechanism includes eye and head tracking, allowing for eye contact with the user, and lip synchronization with speech.

# System Requirements

The Terbinari software is designed to be compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems and requires speech synthesis/recognition references.
The robot control device is powered by a 6V power supply and connects to the computer via USB serial port.

# Conclusion

The Terbinari software and device is a tool for interactive training and conversation, with the ability to learn, interact, and understand natural language. Its robot control mechanism provides a unique and engaging experience for users, making it well-suited for use in educational and therapeutic settings, as well as for human-robot interaction research.
