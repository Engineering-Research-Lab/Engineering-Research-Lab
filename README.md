- The software is able to learn, interact, and deepen its understanding through communication with its user/interlocutor.
- It can operate as a topic teacher, such as in the field of astronomy, and answer questions based on its stored memory.
- The software supports conversation in text-to-text, text-to-voice, and speech-to-voice modes and can recognize voice input.
- The robot control mechanism includes eye and head tracking, allowing for eye contact with the user, and lip synchronization with speech.

### System Requirements

The Terbinari software is designed to be compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems and requires speech synthesis/recognition references.
The robot control device is powered by a 6V power supply and connects to the computer via USB serial port.

### Conclusion

The Terbinari software and device is a tool for interactive training and conversation, with the ability to learn, interact, and understand natural language. Its robot control mechanism provides a unique and engaging experience for users, making it well-suited for use in educational and therapeutic settings, as well as for human-robot interaction research.

### Research on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics 

The project began in 2016 with a focus on multidisciplinary engineering, utilizing techniques in computational linguistics, natural language processing, machine and robot learning, computer vision, and mechatronics. The goal of the research is to design and investigate synthetic entity architecture, information processing algorithms, and control methods to create building blocks for a learning and dialogue system, integrated with humanoid and bio-inspired robotics. The aim is to invent a prototype design for an "AI robotic biome" with a focus on assistive, educational, therapeutic, and humanitarian applications through a human-machine interface.
