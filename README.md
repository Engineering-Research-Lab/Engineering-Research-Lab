# Software and device

  Terbinari operating program represents interactive training and conversation model, natural language processing semantic analysis/matching logic algorithms and controller operating methods.

  Artificial conversational entity performs input/output question-answering, learning, spoken dialog system with multi-function chat-bot interface and anthropomorphic humanoid robot Control Bot Mechanism animatronics operator. Cervical motility device implements mouth speech events motion and eyes/head tracking contact and response under facial detection/recognition process of computer vision.

  Bot operates individual unique memory content updated by Interlocutor input in frames of the system legal code. Answer defines output for dialogue as a tool of reflective analysis by returning efferent recall from human-like machine cognitive function. Embodies autonomous companion simulator as trainable virtual teach assistant and agent of compensatory intercourse for various interactive communication tasks.
    
# Conversations

 Following ![video session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLz-uAJOvLjs0D5dGJIcGOwpURkVAGzvHU&v=m1xcjhqGcHw&feature=youtu.be) represents interaction with Terbinari operating program artificial conversational entity training and dialogue model I/O QA system semantic processing algorithms with chat-bot interface and prototype humanoid robot CBM (Control Bot Mechanism) device.
  
## Overview

  Operating program interface interacts with training and conversation system response output personified in artificial entity endowed with individual memory slot, represents dialog processing models in text-to-text, text-to-voice or voice-to-voice modes and robot control methods, which mechanical recall provides tracking orientation and eye contact with user/interlocutor, as well as mouth device synchronization with speech motility events.

## Prototype application compatibility and usage

  Particular Terbinari software implementation developed on Microsoft Windows OS platform with using of system speech synthesis/recognition references and external CV library output.
