# Software and device

  Terbinari operating program represents interactive training and conversation model, natural language processing semantic analysis/matching logic algorithms and controller operating methods.
  
  Artificial conversational entity performs input/output question-answering, learning, spoken dialog system with multi-function chat-bot interface and anthropomorphic humanoid robot Control Bot Mechanism animatronics operator. Cervical motility device implements mouth speech events motion and eyes/head tracking contact and response under facial detection/recognition process of computer vision.

  Bot operates individual unique memory content updated by Interlocutor input in frames of the system legal code. Answer defines output for dialogue as a tool of reflective analysis by returning efferent recall from human-like machine cognitive function. Embodies autonomous companion simulator as trainable virtual teach assistant and agent of compensatory intercourse for various interactive communication tasks.

## Overview

  Operating program interface interacts with training and conversation system response output personified in artificial entity endowed with individual memory slot, represents dialog processing models in text-to-text, text-to-voice or voice-to-voice modes and robot control methods, which mechanical recall provides tracking orientation and eye contact with user/interlocutor, as well as mouth device synchronization with speech motility events.

## Prototype application compatibility and usage

  Particular Terbinari software implementation developed on Microsoft Windows OS platform with using of system speech synthesis/recognition references and external CV library output.
  
# Processing

 Training and conversation model are close to the natural way of receiving information, when we ask question and answering, looking or requesting for answer. This way training turn into the way of writing a book by creating contextual scenario of personality able to process, evaluate and use this data for internal construction of semantic association and dialogue generation.

 Training and conversation starts from empty memory content, during dialog, void starts fill up and grow by individual user/teacher interlocutor input, giving and requesting for questions/answers, thereby building artificial entity personified memory content to reflect and manipulate with direct return, search or generating answer through the processing and understanding of existing content, create and dynamically follow context nodes, find meaning of the subject by relations from entire content without direct link between word and its meaning at the time of determination, output hypothetical conclusion and request for new key of value.

 Return of direct answers to given questions prescribing by user/interlocutor through the processing core directly reflects or operates to understand content of conversation, defining answer, and building personality structure to output cognitive recall on computational semantics level.
 
 # Functionality

  Neutral language processing/generation semantic analysis/matching algorithms brain core and operation control methods I/O system with multi-function chat-bot terminal desktop software application interface and head/eyes/mouth control bot mechanism robot device with position/coordinate step receiver controller.
  
    <!--![alt text](https://github.com/ladooniani/tailab/blob/master/assets/terbinari-pro-1.png)-->

  • Learn from communication and talk to interlocutor, answer and ask with memory adding/editing option, providing functions control built-in conversation interface in frames of system legal code filter, receive and react to action commands by attached request.

  • Operate as topic teacher e.g. with "astronomy" appeal, question contexts and answer output.
  
    <!--![alt text](https://github.com/ladooniani/tailab/blob/master/assets/terbinari-cbm.jpg)-->
  
  • Support conversation in text-to-text, text-to-voice, speech-to-voice with input pronunciation type chats and voice-to-voice speech recognition mode, operate in open training and close testing memory state with answer not found condition search method and speak with mouth lips viseme motility event.

  • See – detect, recognize introduced person, track with eye contact and head orientation following interlocutor position, blink eyelids.

  Desktop application software installation provides access to system terminal chat-bot interface and 6V CBM robot controller device with USB serial port connection, going through registration in Unit Network user profile access to local and server based memory storage with using of Microsoft OS speech references and available system display language.

# Research and technology development

 "Toy Artificial Intelligence" science, technology and engineering laboratory operates on an independent creative platform of experimental development research in the field of intelligent systems and mechanical engineering, based on original concepts of computing techniques in computational linguistics, automatic natural language processing/generation, machine/robot learning, computer vision and mechatronics by inventor Lado Oniani, such as training and conversation model, semantic analysis and controller motility operator methods. 

 Implementation startup was started in 2016 with multidisciplinary engineering approach, inspired and based on idea create information processing algorithms and operation control methods, design artificial conversational entity cognitive/associative learning/dialogue system, integrated with anthropomorphic humanoid and bio-inspired robotics architecture, and prototype custom assistive technology solution, adaptable for specialized use, such as education, cognitive therapy or entertainment with modeling and simulation conversational setup via human-machine interface, behavior observation, study, development, optimization and accumulation potentially derivative experiment. 

 Conversational interaction prescribable for such tasks as assistance of topical training, autism educational/therapy exercise, as well psycho-linguistics and synthetic psychology human-robot interaction experiment, or any other specific usage with requirement of creating contextual memory content and dialog model scenario performance within building semantically personified cognition and output structure display with reflective experience, capable differentiate content based meaning and use logic to find relationship between contextual values.
 
 Synthetic entity able to learn and interact, providing grow and using of personal unique memory content as key to the abstract path in process of creation building blocks of contextual association system and deepening of abstraction by inherent characteristics as functionally surrounded void, that does not knows anything by default, able endlessly learn, understand meaning of  information and use it to build synthetic personality, become perceptive carrier to reflect and inference received informational knowledge in natural way of dynamic conversation with simplicity and softness in interaction feedback.



# Support project
  
  Laboratory founded as non profit scientific and engineering organization.

Practical experience and development process in research is aimed to create and investigate synthetic entity architecture and behavior.

The philosophy of vision in research, inspired and motivated by concept to invent and build experimental and assistive educational, therapeutic, social and humanitarian interactive and robotic technologies, as well as implying prototyping and manufacturing products with commercial potential.

Research and development includes a number of areas, such as computational logic, cognitive science, mechanical design/engineering and industrial/artistic design
