Artificial conversational entity performs input/output question-answering, learning, spoken dialog system with multi-function chat-bot interface and anthropomorphic humanoid robot Control Bot Mechanism animatronics operator. The cervical motility device implements mouth speech events motion and eyes/head tracking contact and response under facial detection/recognition process of computer vision.

The bot operates individual unique memory content updated by interlocutor input in frames of the system legal code. The answer defines output for dialogue as a tool of reflective analysis by returning efferent recall from human-like machine cognitive function. Embodies autonomous companion simulator as trainable virtual teaching assistant and agent of compensatory intercourse for various interactive communication tasks.

## Conversations

 The following video sessions represents interaction with Terbinari operating program artificial conversational entity training and dialogue model I/O QA system semantic processing algorithms with chat-bot interface and prototype humanoid robot CBM (Control Bot Mechanism) device.

### Processing  

 The training and conversation model is close to the natural way of receiving information, asking for the question and answering, looking or requesting for the answer, filling memory with user/teacher interlocutor input, generating dialogue, following context, and content-based meaning (check reference: [Inference root/derivative noun algorithm](https://github.com/ladooniani/inference-root-derivative-noun)).

  - Learn from communication and talk to the interlocutor, answer and ask with memory adding/editing option, providing functions control built-in conversation interface in frames of system legal code filter, receive and react to action commands by attached request.

  - Operate as topic teacher e.g. with "astronomy" appeal, question contexts, and answer output.
  
  - Support conversation in text-to-text, text-to-voice, speech-to-voice with input pronunciation type chats and voice-to-voice speech recognition mode, operate in open training and close testing memory state, and speak with mouth lips viseme motility event.
  
  - See ‚Äì detect, recognize introduced person, a track with eye contact and head orientation following interlocutor position, blinking eyelids.
