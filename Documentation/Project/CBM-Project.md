### CBM Control Bot Mechanism 

The robot's control mechanism delivers a unique and engaging user experience, suitable for educational, therapeutic, and human-robot interaction research settings. Combining software and mechanical R&D, this initiative targets tailored solutions for therapeutic approaches such as Robot-Assisted Therapy/Training (RAT), addressing psychological and neurological conditions. The CBM robot head aims to explore educational and therapeutic applications through human-machine interaction.

### Functionality 

The CBM project presents a modular mechanical head capsule robot prototype integrating AI chatbots for basic facial interactivity motor functions. It comprises a chat-bot interface and a humanoid robot control mechanism. The control mechanism includes a **SVM (Speech Viseme Motility Method/Mechanism)** for speech motion. It incorporates a library of motility functions and calibration software application.

The mechanism performs phonetically synchronized speech with basic positions group of mouth lips facial muscle and jaw movement, reduced by fusion with excluded visemes, which combination includes tongue and teeth, using Viseme/Phoneme event set reference: [System.Speech.Synthesis Namespace SpeechSynthesizer.VisemeReached Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.speech.synthesis.speechsynthesizer.visemereached?view=netframework-4.8)
 
**VCM (Vision Control Motility Method/Mechanism)** module device facial detection/recognition, enabling computer vision face tracking/coordination with eye contact and head coordination.

### Operating System Application Software Library Interface
 
The Humanoid Robot software and device is an artificial conversational entity that performs natural language processing, understanding, and generation, is a tool for interactive training and conversation, with the ability to learn, interact, and understand natural language. It is composed of a chat-bot interface and a humanoid robot control mechanism, which includes a cervical motility device for speech motion and facial detection/recognition. Its robot control mechanism provides a unique and engaging experience for users, making it well-suited for use in educational and therapeutic settings, as well as for human-robot interaction research.

- The robot control mechanism includes eye and head tracking, allowing for eye contact with the user, and lip synchronization with speech. 
- The software is able to learn, interact, and deepen its understanding through communication with its user/interlocutor.
- It can operate as a topic teacher, such as in the field of astronomy, and answer questions based on its stored memory.
- The software supports conversation in text-to-text, text-to-voice, and speech-to-voice modes and can recognize voice input.

### System Requirements

The CBM software is designed to be compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems and requires speech synthesis/recognition references.
The robot control device is powered by a 6V power supply and connects to the computer via USB serial port.
