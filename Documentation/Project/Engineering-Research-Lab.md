### Approach and Goals:
Our laboratory is a multidisciplinary research platform that specializes in experimental development and self-education, primarily focusing on software engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial design. Our conceptual vision revolves around inventing and implementing prototype designs for robotic platform development, mechatronic and robotics devices, artificial entities, and AI applications. This involves designing algorithms and implementing methods and techniques in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, environmental and peripheral web and desktop application infrastructure, and interactive network systems. We strive to create an artificial psychophysical mechanism and an experimental environment installation interface. Our overarching goal is to invent custom assistive educational, therapeutic, social, humanitarian, interactive, and robotic solutions that are adaptable for specialized uses.

The aim of our research is to design and investigate synthetic entity architecture, information processing algorithms, and control methods to develop building blocks for a learning and dialogue system, integrated with humanoid and bio-inspired robotics. Our laboratory focuses on modeling and simulating conversational setups through a human-machine interface, studying, developing, optimizing, and accumulating potentially derivative experiments. We aim to create a prototyping environment that enables us to invent and develop devices by designing algorithms and implementing methods. Additionally, our process encompasses work data management, graphics, and game development.

### Experimental Development
The project began in 2016 with a focus on multidisciplinary engineering, utilizing techniques in computational linguistics, natural language processing, machine and robot learning, computer vision, and mechatronics. The goal of the research is to design and investigate synthetic entity architecture, information processing algorithms, and control methods to create building blocks for a learning and dialogue system, integrated with humanoid and bio-inspired robotics. The aim is to invent a prototype design with a focus on assistive, educational, and therapeutic applications through a human-machine interface.

### Conceptual Vision
The laboratory serves as a multidisciplinary research platform dedicated to experimental development and self-education, with a primary focus on software engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial design. Our conceptual vision centers around the creation and implementation of prototype designs for various applications, including robotic platform development, mechatronic and robotics devices, artificial entities, and AI applications. This encompasses the design of algorithms and the implementation of methods and techniques in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, as well as environmental and peripheral web and desktop application infrastructure, and interactive network systems. Our ultimate aim is to develop an artificial psychophysical mechanism and an experimental environment installation interface. Our overarching goal is to invent custom assistive educational, therapeutic, social, humanitarian, interactive, and robotic solutions adaptable for specialized uses.

The workflow of our virtual laboratory primarily revolves around modeling and simulating conversational setups via a human-machine interface. We focus on studying, developing, optimizing, and accumulating potentially derivative experiments. Our objective is to establish a prototyping environment conducive to inventing and developing devices by designing algorithms and implementing methods. Additionally, our process includes managing work data, graphics, and game development.

### Engineering Approach
We prioritize a technical and conceptual approach that emphasizes lightweight, compact, and easy-to-assemble designs. Our objective is to utilize a minimal number of actuators and minimize energy consumption. This is achieved through the implementation of mechanical and mechatronic modular devices, along with efficient operational control solutions.

Focused on minimal hardware, our emphasis lies on the robot and its minimal OS, comprising code libraries for core functions as constructor modules. The design prioritizes softness and hardware minimization, making it ideal for low-budget implementations and startups. The modular nature of the robot head allows for further development or integration into separate projects.
