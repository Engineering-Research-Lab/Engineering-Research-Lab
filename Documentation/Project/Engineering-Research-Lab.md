### Approach and Goals:
Our laboratory is a multidisciplinary research platform that specializes in experimental development and self-education, primarily focusing on software engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial design. Our conceptual vision revolves around inventing and implementing prototype designs for robotic platform development, mechatronic and robotics devices, artificial entities, and AI applications. This involves designing algorithms and implementing methods and techniques in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, environmental and peripheral web and desktop application infrastructure, and interactive network systems. We strive to create an artificial psychophysical mechanism and an experimental environment installation interface. Our overarching goal is to invent custom assistive educational, therapeutic, social, humanitarian, interactive, and robotic solutions that are adaptable for specialized uses.

The aim of our research is to design and investigate synthetic entity architecture, information processing algorithms, and control methods to develop building blocks for a learning and dialogue system, integrated with humanoid and bio-inspired robotics. Our laboratory focuses on modeling and simulating conversational setups through a human-machine interface, studying, developing, optimizing, and accumulating potentially derivative experiments. We aim to create a prototyping environment that enables us to invent and develop devices by designing algorithms and implementing methods. Additionally, our process encompasses work data management, graphics, and game development.
